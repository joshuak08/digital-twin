> _Nijhuis Saur Industries provides solid and adaptive solutions for sustainable and resilient water use, energy and resource recovery around the world._ - [Nijhuis Industries](https://www.nijhuisindustries.com/)

Water treatment plants need a tool which can help improve the planning, design, contruction and operation of their plants. 
A digital twin of a water system will provide accurate and reliable data of that can used to make informed decisions throughout 
the lifecycle of that water system. \
This will consist of: 
  - A front-end in Django. 
  - A backend in pyRevit to interface with Revit APIs.

## 1.3 Planning

Main planned features include:
- 3D modelling of plant details, similar to tools like Revit.
- Ability to simulate running process of a plant designed in the software.
- Ability to connect the software to a live system to allow for updates to the model from the real world.
  - Including visual updates to the 3D model.
- Ability to use the software to control real world components.
